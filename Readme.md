## Installation

### Requirements:
    * ObsPy >= 0.8

### Installation

Checkout the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krischer/wfs_input_generator.git
cd wfs_input_generator
```

The recommended way to install the waveform solver input file generator is via
a develop install. This means that you are still able to edit the code and add
new generators.

To do this, either use

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

or

```bash
pip install -v -e .
```

Both work fine.
